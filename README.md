# Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Neural-Networks-And-Image-processing-Techniques
• A CNN model was assembled and trained to classify photographs of different types of leaves and identify the diseases which infected the leaves 
• The model was tested for a dataset of almost 60000 leaf images 
• It was measured how the accuracy depends on the number of epochs in order to detect potential overfitting problem.
